    John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and $268.
    To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.
    In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
    1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
    2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).
    (NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2)
    GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

    var tipBillArr = [];

      if (billAmount < 50) {
        var tipAmount = (billAmount * 20) / 100;
        tipArr.push(tipAmount);
        tipBillArr.push(tipAmount + billAmount);
      } else if (billAmount < 200) {
        var tipAmount = (billAmount * 15) / 100;
        tipArr.push(tipAmount);
        tipBillArr.push(tipAmount + billAmount);
